# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Jeffrey Ye, pronouns he/him. I'm a first year in GDIM and I mainly play turn-based or strategy games. I'm taking this class because it is part of my course requirements and I have very minimal experience in game development over scratch and java. I hope to build games that I myself want to play/

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I'm hoping to learn basic game programming and also skills that can be carried over to other classes and the future.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
Originally, I was concerned about using the Unity engine but after your spiel about not needing to know any coding at all, I think I will do fine in this course.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
Java

2. Game development (any engine)

3. Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**
